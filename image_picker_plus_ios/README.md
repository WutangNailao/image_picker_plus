# image\_picker\_plus\_ios

The iOS implementation of [`image_picker_plus`][1].

## Usage

Most apps should depend on `image_picker_plus` rather than this package
directly. This package is pulled in automatically when you use
`image_picker_plus`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
